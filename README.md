# ep-trafficstops
Final project for Data Visualization Spring 2023

This project uses Poetry for dependency management. After installing the dependencies in `poetry.toml`, 
the code can be run (see https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies). 

To run the Streamlit app in a local browser window, run `streamlit run app.py` in command line from the 
`ep-trafficstops` directory.
